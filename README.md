# ðŸš• Analysis of Chicago Taxi Trips

</div>

## Introduction
Our main objective is to analyse the taxi data for the city of Chicago for the time period of 2013 - 2018. Our goals are:

0. [Data Cleaning](/0_data_preparation)
1. [Initial Exploratory Analysis](/1_exploratory_analysis)
2. [Price analysis and prediction](/2_price_analysis)
3. [Correlate with Weather/CTA Data](/4_correlations)
4. [**TaxiPool**](/4_taxipool): Cluster people by 5 dimensions (Pickup LAT & LON, Dropoff LAT & LON, Start time), to prove we can put a lot of people with matching trips inside the same taxi.
5. [**ProfitMaximiser**](/5_profit_maximiser): Predict where to place your taxi to maximize likelihood of getting a client, based on time of day (and weather?).
